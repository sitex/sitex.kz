[Zeal](http://zealdocs.org/) is a simple offline API documentation browser inspired by [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) (OS X app), available for Linux and Windows.

- Quickly search documentation using Alt+Space (or customised) hotkey to display Zeal from any place in your workspace.
- Search in multiple sets of documentation at once.
- Don't be dependent on your internet connection.
- Integrate Zeal with Emacs, Sublime Text, or Vim. See Usage Â» Editor plugins for details.
