I had this issue with npm v1.1.4 (and node v0.6.12), which are the Ubuntu 12.04 repository versions.

It looks like that version of npm isn't supported any more, updating node (and npm with it) resolved the issue.

First, uninstall the outdated version (optional, but I think this fixed an issue I was having with global modules not being pathed in).

- sudo apt-get purge nodejs npm

Then install from Chris Lea's repo:

- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install -y python-software-properties python g++ make
- sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install nodejs
